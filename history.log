PROMPT_FEATURES: {'CO': 0.6, 'NO2': 40.0, 'PT08S1': 650.0, 'Temperature': 15.0, 'Relative Humidity': 40.0, 'Absolute Humidity': 0.5}
PREDICTION: Good
EXPLANATION: The AQI classification model predicted "Good" air quality because all the measured factors are at levels typically associated with clean and healthy air.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

*   **CO (Carbon Monoxide): 0.6**
    *   **Influence:** Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas, especially at high levels, affecting breathing and heart health.
    *   **Why "Good":** The CO level of 0.6 is very low, meaning there's hardly any of this pollutant in the air. This is excellent for air quality.

*   **NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): 40.0**
    *   **Influence:** Nitrogen dioxide is a gas that can irritate the lungs and contribute to respiratory problems.
    *   **Why "Good":** The NO2 level of 40.0 is also quite low. This indicates minimal pollution from sources like vehicle exhaust or power plants.

*   **PT08S1 (Tin Dioxide Sensor): 650.0**
    *   **Influence:** This sensor helps detect certain pollutants like carbon monoxide and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Higher readings can sometimes mean more pollution.
    *   **Why "Good":** The sensor reading of 650.0 is at a level that suggests low amounts of these specific pollutants in the air.

*   **Temperature: 15.0**
    *   **Influence:** Temperature isn't a pollutant itself, but extreme heat or cold can sometimes affect how pollutants form and spread.
    *   **Why "Good":** A mild temperature of 15.0 degrees Celsius is generally neutral and doesn't promote poor air quality.

*   **Relative Humidity: 40.0%**
    *   **Influence:** Humidity can influence how certain pollutants form or how easily dust travels.
    *   **Why "Good":** A relative humidity of 40.0% is a comfortable and moderate level, which is generally not a factor that would worsen air quality.

*   **Absolute Humidity: 0.5**
    *   **Influence:** Absolute humidity measures the actual amount of water vapor in the air, which can also play a role in pollutant chemistry.
    *   **Why "Good":** The absolute humidity of 0.5 is low, meaning there isn't a lot of water vapor to significantly contribute to pollutant formation or reactions.

**Overall Conclusion:** All the pollutant levels (CO, NO2, and PT08S1 sensor reading) are very low, while the environmental conditions (temperature, relative and absolute humidity) are mild and favorable. Together, these factors strongly support the "Good" air quality prediction.

PREDICTION: Poor
EXPLANATION: Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the features influence air quality, leading to a "Poor" prediction:

*   **CO (Carbon Monoxide): 1.2**
    Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a harmful gas; higher levels make the air quality worse as it affects breathing.
*   **NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): 120.0**
    Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a pollutant often from cars and industries; higher amounts can irritate lungs and contribute to poor air quality.
*   **PT08S1: 720.0**
    The PT08S1 sensor detects certain pollutants in the air; a higher reading suggests more harmful substances are present.
*   **Temperature: 22.0**
    Temperature can affect how chemical pollutants are formed and how they spread or get trapped in the air, influencing overall air quality.
*   **Relative Humidity: 60.0**
    Relative Humidity (the amount of moisture in the air) can influence how pollutants react and form new particles, sometimes contributing to haze and poorer air.
*   **Absolute Humidity: 0.9**
    Absolute Humidity (the total amount of water vapor) also plays a role in atmospheric chemistry, affecting how pollutants behave and their impact on air quality.

FEATURES: {'CO': 0.6, 'NO2': 40.0, 'PT08S1': 650.0, 'Temperature': 15.0, 'Relative Humidity': 40.0, 'Absolute Humidity': 0.5}
PREDICTION: Good
EXPLANATION: Here's a step-by-step explanation of the AQI prediction:

**Explanation of Good Air Quality**

Based on the provided readings, the air quality is predicted to be Good because:

*   **CO (Carbon Monoxide): 0.6**
    Low levels of Carbon Monoxide like 0.6 mean the air is cleaner and safer to breathe.
